# JS-By-Example

This is a repository of sample, short tasks solved in Javascript. Some of presenting examples contain more than one solution. Each solution is in a separate root directory for a given task. For example first from list is:

```
 - J00 - Display the current day and time.
 ```
The directory has two files ```01.js``` and ```02.js```.  Both there are other solutions.



### Examples 

 - J00 - Display the current day and time.
 - J01 - Check if the year is a leap year.
 - J02 - Guess the number from random numbers 1 to 5.
 - J03 - Calculator (Add, Substract, Divide, Multiply).
 - J04 - Temperature converter (Celsius - Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit - Celsius).
 - J05 - Sum two integers - if integers are the same then return increased sm by four times.
 - J06 - Sum two integers - if integers are the same substract first value from second. If first integer is bigger than second integer, return string ```First value is bigger than second```. If first integer is smaller or equal to second - multiply them.
 - J07 - Add in front of string 'X'. If string starts with 'X' or 'x' letter - return given string. If string is empty - return 'X'.
 - J08 - Change position of first and last letter in given string.
 - J09 - Find largest integer from five elements.
 - J10 - Convert first character in string to uppercase.
 - J11 - Reverse string.
